# Adaptive music mod framework for arma 3.


Hello All,

This is an open source project for the Arma 3 Adaptive music mod framework.

The current build will be replaced by the framework you see before you eventually.

Please feel free to fork this or start working on some upgrades/ enhancements. The more eyes and hands we have, we will have a masterpiece in the end.

Thanks for the support from the community and friends regarding the project's growth so far!


# What is this mod?
This mod is a completely dynamic mod that changes the music based on the player's character surroundings or situation. The mod runs on a stress meter that maxes out at level 60 and controls when to change to a combat senario. This mod is completely independent from any Zuse or server controled operations and is processed client side only.

# What kinds of situations or soundsets does this framework support or provide

The current build on the steam workshop has the current soundsets.

# On foot (non-combat)
  - Day/Night Cycle 
  - Rain weather
  - Fog weather
  - Skydiving (or when character is out of a vehicle over 100 meters above any surface.)
  - Scuba Diving (or when under 5 meters under water.)

# Vehicle (non-combat
  - Cars (invoves any wheeled APCs or cars.)
  - Tanks (invoves any Tracked vehicles.)
  - Helicopters (involves anything with a helicopter class.)
  - Planes (involves anything with a plane class.)
  - Submarines (technically they classify as a boat but will enable when under 10 meters under water.)
  - Turrets (since it is basically infantry based, it will follow On foot sound sets.)

# (combat)
  - Infantry Day/Night (will follow the same sound sets unless it gets made into two different ones.)
  - Infantry Fog (made this one origionally for horror but is a soundset.)
  - Vehicle (Combat for all vehicles.)
  
 
 # What Kinds of future soundsets or features I want to add?
 
  - Some better music fading or transiton techniques for sure.
  - Possibly a soundset that fires off when an enemy is near by (within 20 meters or something. If it is whenever an enemy gets alerted, that will not be possible for me)
