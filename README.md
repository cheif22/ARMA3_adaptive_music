# Adaptive music mod framework for arma 3.


Hello All,

This is an open source project for the Arma 3 Adaptive music mod framework.

The current build will be replaced by the framework you see before you eventually.

Please feel free to fork this or start working on some upgrades/ enhancements. The more eyes and hands we have, we will have a masterpiece in the end.

Thanks for the support from the community and friends regarding the project's growth so far!


[h1][b]What is this mod? [/b][/h1]
This mod is a completely dynamic mod that changes the music based on the player's character surroundings or situation. The mod runs on a stress meter that maxes out at level 60 and controls when to change to a combat senario. This mod is completely independent from any Zuse or server controled operations and is processed client side only.

[h1][b]What kinds of situations or soundsets does this framework support or provide[/b][/h1]

The current build on the steam workshop has the current soundsets.

[b]On foot (non combat)[/b]
  - Day/Night Cycle
  - Rain weather
  - Fog weather
  - Skydiving (or when character is out of a vehicle over 100 meters above any surface).
  - Scuba Diving (or when under 5 meters under water).
